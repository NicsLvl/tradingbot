# tradingbot
This repository was a school project for a real time trading bot using K-nearest neighbours (KNN) algorithm (sklearn) for Case Based Reasoning (CBR) to automate trades based on real time twitter sentiment analysis (textblob), commodities, equity prices and moving averages for Ethereum/USDT and EOS/USDT. Based on historical training data, every 5 minute interval was classified as a gain or loss using KNN and each new interval that passed was a new “case”.
